            <h2>History</h2>

            <p>Batman is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics.
                The character was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and debuted in
                the 27th issue of the comic book Detective Comics on March 30, 1939. In the DC Universe
                continuity, Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy,
                philanthropist, and industrialist who resides in Gotham City. Batman's origin story
                features him swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the murder of his
                parents Thomas and Martha as a child, a vendetta tempered with the ideal of justice.
                He trains himself physically and intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona, and
                monitors the Gotham streets at night. Kane, Finger, and other creators accompanied
                Batman with supporting characters, including his sidekicks Robin and Batgirl; allies
                Alfred Pennyworth, James Gordon, and Catwoman; and foes such as the Penguin, the Riddler,
                Two-Face, and his archenemy, the Joker.</p>

            <h2>Origin</h2>

            <p>One day I called Bill and said, 'I have a new character called the Bat-Man
                and I've made some crude, elementary sketches I'd like you to look at.'He came over
                and I showed him the drawings. At the time, I only had a small domino mask,
                like the one Robin later wore, on Batman's face. Bill said, 'Why not make him look
                more like a bat and put a hood on him, and take the eyeballs out and just put slits for
                eyes to make him look more mysterious?' At this point, the Bat-Man wore a red union suit;
                the wings, trunks, and mask were black. I thought that red and black would be a good
                combination. Bill said that the costume was too bright: 'Color it dark grey to make it
                look more ominous.' The cape looked like two stiff bat wings attached to his arms. As Bill
                and I talked, we realized that these wings would get cumbersome when Bat-Man was in action
                and changed them into a cape, scalloped to look like bat wings when he was fighting or
                swinging down on a rope. Also, he didn't have any gloves on, and we added them so that he
                wouldn't leave fingerprints.[14]</p>

            <h2>Popular Culture</h2>
            <p>Batman has become a pop culture icon, recognized around the world. The character's
                presence has extended beyond his comic book origins; events such as the release of the
                1989 Batman film and its accompanying merchandising "brought the Batman to the forefront of
                public consciousness".[201] In an article commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the
                character, The Guardian wrote, "Batman is a figure blurred by the endless reinvention that is
                modern mass culture. He is at once an icon and a commodity: the perfect cultural artefact for
                the 21st century."[202]</p>
