                <br>The character was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and debuted in
                the 27th issue of the comic book Detective Comics on March 30, 1939.
                <br>In the DC Universe
                continuity, Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy,
                philanthropist, and industrialist who resides in Gotham City.
                <br>Batman's origin story
                features him swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the murder of his

            <h2>Origin</h2>

            <p>One day I called Bill and said, 'I have a new character called the Bat-Man
                and I've made some crude, elementary sketches I'd like you to look at.'He came over
                and I showed him the drawings. At the time, I only had a small domino mask,
                like the one Robin later wore, on Batman's face. Bill said, 'Why not make him look
                more like a bat and put a hood on him, and take the eyeballs out and just put slits for
                eyes to make him look more mysterious?' At this point, the Bat-Man wore a red union suit;
                the wings, trunks, and mask were black. I thought that red and black would be a good
                combination. Bill said that the costume was too bright: 'Color it dark grey to make it
                look more ominous.' The cape looked like two stiff bat wings attached to his arms. As Bill
                and I talked, we realized that these wings would get cumbersome when Bat-Man was in action
                and changed them into a cape, scalloped to look like bat wings when he was fighting or
                swinging down on a rope. Also, he didn't have any gloves on, and we added them so that he
                wouldn't leave fingerprints.[14]</p>

            <h2>Popular Culture</h2>
            <p>Batman has become a pop culture icon, recognized around the world. The character's
                presence has extended beyond his comic book origins; events such as the release of the
                1989 Batman film and its accompanying merchandising "brought the Batman to the forefront of
                public consciousness".[201] In an article commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the
                character, The Guardian wrote, "Batman is a figure blurred by the endless reinvention that is
                modern mass culture. He is at once an icon and a commodity: the perfect cultural artefact for
                the 21st century."[202]</p>
