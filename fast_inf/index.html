                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                    language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                    extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example: <br>
                </p>

                <h2>What you should already know</h2>

                <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                    <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                    <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on
                        the
                        main page about JavaScript.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>

                <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                    JavaScript
                    language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                    follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was
                    the
                    reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript. <br>

                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                    runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                    values.
                    JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model.
                    The
                    prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for
                    individual
                    objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions
                    can
                    be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.<br>

                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                    classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                    protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return
                    types
                    are not explicitly typed.<br>
                </p>
                <h2>Hello world</h2>
                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                    JavaScript code:</p>
                <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                    greetMe("World");</code>

                <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>

                <h2>Variables</h2>

                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                    identifiers, conform to certain rules.

                    A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                    characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                    characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).

                    You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the
                    Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits,
                    temp99, and _name.</p>

                <h2>Declaring variables</h2>

                <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:
                    With the keyword var. For example,
                    </p>

                <code>var x = 42.</code>

                <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.

                    By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>

                <code>x = 42.</code>

                <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.

                    With the keyword let. For example,</p>

                <code>let y = 13.</code>

                <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
